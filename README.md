Objective Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. 
Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video. 
Task Given a string, 5, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N — 1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space. 
separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail). Note: 0 is considered to be an even index. 
Example s adbccf Print abc clef Input Format The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases). 
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S. 
Constraints • 1 < T < 10 • 2 < length of S < 10000 Output Format For each String Si (where 0 < j < T — 1), 
print Si's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sis odd-indexed characters. 
Sample Input 2 Hacker Rank Sample Output Hce akr Rn ak 
Explanation 
Test Case 0: S = "Hacker" 5[0] = "H" .9[1] = "a" s[z] = ,,e, S[3] = ”k» S[4] = "e" S[5] = »r), 
The even indices are 0, 2, and 4, and the odd indices are 1, 3, and 5. We then print a single line of 2 space-separated strings; 
the first string contains the ordered characters from S's even indices (lice), and the second string contains the ordered characters from S's odd indices (akr). 
Test Case 1: S = "Rank" 5[0] = "R" 69[1] = "a" S[2] = "n" S[3] = ie) The even indices are 0 and 2, and the odd indices are 1 and 3. 
We then print a single line of 2 space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from S's even indices (Rn), 
and the second string contains the ordered characters from S :::dd indices (ak).
